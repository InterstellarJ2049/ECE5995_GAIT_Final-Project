### Introduction
In this project, we decided to embrace the OpenAI API by using OpenAI tools as much as possible to design a Web App.

### Approach
* Build an interface that listens to the speech, translates it into the language we want in the text, and transforms it back to the speech in the user’s language. (Whisper, ChatGPT, TTS)
* Build an interface that can describe an image in users’ native language (ChatGPT-4V)

### TBD
* User log-in function
